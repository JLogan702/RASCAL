      <strong>These dashboards are designed to inform—not punish.</strong> Our goal is to provide objective visibility into the state of story ticket flow across the program. This summary aggregates the status of upcoming sprints and backlog grooming across all teams. Use this as a conversation starter and improvement guide.

        <li><strong>Backlog Health</strong> = % of all non-done stories in grooming statuses assigned to future sprints</li>
        <li>Each team has separate calculations displayed on their dedicated tabs</li>

        This light reflects an aggregate readiness + backlog health score using weighted logic across all five teams.
