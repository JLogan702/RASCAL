    "Description":"Delta Lake statistics optimization should be implemented by removing long text fields from the statistics collection. Delta automatically collects statistics on the first N columns (default 32) which enable metadata-only queries and file skipping capabilities, significantly improving query performance. However, timestamp and string types, especially long strings, reduce the effectiveness of these statistics due to precision issues and truncation that prevent exact matches. To optimize performance, the dataSkippingNumIndexedCols or dataSkippingStatsColumns property can be used to focus statistics collection on the most selective columns, excluding the long text fields that provide minimal query optimization benefit.\n\n||Table property||Databricks Runtime supported||Description||\n|{{delta.dataSkippingNumIndexedCols}}|All supported Databricks Runtime versions|Increase or decrease the number of columns on which Delta collects statistics. Depends on column order.|\n|{{delta.dataSkippingStatsColumns}}|Databricks Runtime 13.3 LTS and above|Specify a list of column names for which Delta Lake collects statistics. Supersedes {{dataSkippingNumIndexedCols}}.|\n\n[Data skipping for Delta Lake | Databricks Documentation|https:\/\/docs.databricks.com\/aws\/en\/delta\/data-skipping]",

After a user creates a Strategy through the UI (creating a StrategySummaryDTO with status 'pending'), AI\/Ops will generate recommendations and emotions for the Strategy, then call this endpoint to provide the details and update the status to 'active'.\n\nThis endpoint is a critical component that bridges the initial user-created strategy with the AI-generated content, enabling the complete Strategy experience.",

    "Description":"As a product manager, I want to see a description of a  hexbin graph and information on new audience segments based on competitor, so that I can identify new audience groups that specific are targeted by competitors.\n\n*Hexbin Example:* [https:\/\/observablehq.com\/collection\/@d3\/d3-hexbin|https:\/\/observablehq.com\/collection\/@d3\/d3-hexbin|smart-link] \n\n*Design:* [Figma|https:\/\/www.figma.com\/design\/U4eAh5Xm51tYKozGaM3QGC\/Explore?t=ooVxtBgGMd9UBLn3-0]\n\n*User Story:* As a marketer, I need to understand how my audiences compare to my competitors' audiences, so I can identify opportunities to target underserved segments and optimize my marketing strategies.\n\n*Description:* Implement the Competitor Audience Insights section of the Explore page that provides marketers with a comprehensive, data-driven view of how different audience segments (previously referred to as community groups) engage with their brand compared to competitors. This multi-faceted analysis page will visualize audience engagement metrics, demographic overlap, sentiment distribution, and engagement trends across brands in the competitive landscape.\n\nThe section will feature interactive data visualizations that allow marketers to explore audience engagement patterns at multiple levels of granularity. Users can compare audience segment performance across competitors through side-by-side metrics, revealing which audience segments show stronger affinity for their brand versus competitors. The analysis will highlight both opportunities (underserved segments where the brand could increase engagement) and threats (segments where competitors have established stronger connections).\n\n*Technical Notes:*\n\n* Endpoint: {{GET \/brand\/{brandId}\/competitor}} and possibly other specialized endpoints since the API note indicates this may need multiple endpoints for the volume of data\n* Response: {{BrandCompetitorDetailsDTO}} (structure TBD in backend implementation)\n* Data source tables: Will need to be defined by engineering team. Please reference [Data Sources for MarTech|https:\/\/evolve24.atlassian.net\/wiki\/spaces\/bgp\/pages\/3091890181\/Data+Sources+for+MarTech] page.\n* Component dependencies:\n** Audience selector component\n** Competitor selector component\n** Data visualization components",

    "Description":"Related to TEP-1418: Reddit Compliance - implement edit support in Databricks pipeline, we need to backfill events from Reddit into the Databricks data warehouse. I do not want to implement backfill the way we did previously because this disrupts stream state; we will need another service to read data from Reddit\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s location and stream it into Databricks, then process it inline using the pathways created by the edit post process.\n\nFrom Reddit:\n\nYou are required to also backfill these {{EDIT}} events in order to keep compliance. This is a larger backfill because, not only {{EDIT}} events are more common, they are also larger, since they contain the full body of the post\/comment being edited. Due to file size limitations, we were not able to share these with you via Google Drive, and we're instead providing you with a Google Cloud Bucket, only accessible by your team, where you will find all {{EDIT}} events that took place during the outage.\nYou can find credentials for the bucket, as well as instructions on how to perform this backfill in the document I shared in our Google Drive folder here:\n[https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1TbjEA9OgyGUktlM8dauyz4is-lhph1mqgE5gY9CXAXs\/edit?usp=drive_link|https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1TbjEA9OgyGUktlM8dauyz4is-lhph1mqgE5gY9CXAXs\/edit?usp=drive_link|smart-link] ",

Additional Notes\n\n* The modal design follows the pattern established in the design system - ensure consistency with other modals\n* The \"Add to strategy\" functionality may need to be implemented in a separate ticket if it requires complex integration with the Strategy Builder\n* Consider implementing skeleton loading states for better UX while data is loading\n* Ensure the audience overview text area can handle variable length content\n* Table should have proper scrolling behavior if the number of segments exceeds the visible area\n* Verify with product team if the color gradient is based on a specific metric or just for visual differentiation",

    "Description":"As a marketer, I want accurate reach numbers that account for audience overlap between communities and topics, so I can make informed decisions about my marketing strategy and budget allocation.\n\n*Context*: We need to implement a high-performance service that calculates deduplicated audience reach across multiple communities, topics, and demographic segments. This service is a core component of the Clarvos platform that will enable marketers to accurately measure potential campaign impact.\n\nReach is the sum of all authors.\n\nThis is a critical backend service for the Strategy Builder panel that calculates the total potential reach across selected communities and topics. The service needs to account for audience overlap to prevent overestimating reach. Reach equates to one customer that the marketer is targeting. \n\n*User Story*: As a marketing professional, I want to see a real-time total reach calculation as I add or remove communities and topics to my strategy, so I can understand the impact of my selections and optimize for maximum audience coverage.\n\n*Business Value*:\n\n* Provides accurate, deduplicated reach numbers for better budget planning\n* Differentiates from competitors by accounting for audience overlap\n* Enables marketers to make data-driven decisions about which communities to target\n* Increases trust in the platform by providing transparent, accurate metrics\n\n*Internal Product Context*: This service powers the Strategy Builder panel on the homepage, which displays the total estimated reach and a progress bar showing how much of the maximum possible reach has been selected. The calculation needs to update in real-time as users add or remove communities and topics.\n\nConfluence: [https:\/\/evolve24.atlassian.net\/wiki\/spaces\/bgp\/pages\/2806710280\/Entity+Resolution+that+identifies+and+deduplicates+similar+records.|https:\/\/evolve24.atlassian.net\/wiki\/spaces\/bgp\/pages\/2806710280\/Entity+Resolution+that+identifies+and+deduplicates+similar+records.|smart-link] ",

    "Description":"This ticket involves creating the API endpoints needed to power the topics carousel on the homepage, leveraging the BERTopic standard Wikipedia model for topic classification which Data Science has completed and can be found in Databricks:{{dev_data_warehouse.michalm.bertopic_standard_wikipedia_model}}\n\nAs a backend developer, I need to integrate the Topics API to provide data for the homepage carousel so marketers can see the topics that present the greatest opportunity for their brand by community.\n\n\n\n*User Story 1:*\n\nAs a marketer, I want each topic tag to show the estimated total reach so I can assess its potential.\n\nh3. Topics Model Details\n\n* Databricks Model: {{dev_data_warehouse.michalm.bertopic_standard_wikipedia_model}}\n* The Topics model classifies text by identifying semantically relevant topics from a set of 2,377 topic embeddings\n* Each topic has a unique ID, representative keywords, and a human-readable label\n* Matching logic uses cosine similarity with a threshold of 0.4\n* Maximum of 20 topics per input will be returned by the model\n* Results are provided as a tuple of three lists: topic IDs, similarity scores, and topic label\n* {noformat}(\n  [topic_id_1, topic_id_2, ...],         # Topic IDs\n  [score_1, score_2, ...],               # Similarity scores (float)\n  [label_1, label_2, ...]                # Corresponding topic labels\n){noformat}\n\nh2. Edge Cases\n\n* Handle scenarios where topics data is not available\n* Implement proper error handling for model API failures\n* Handle rate limiting and performance concerns\n* Consider pagination for initial load vs. \"load more\" functionality\n* Handle cases where fewer than 10 topics meet the similarity threshold\n* Ensure consistent ordering when topics have identical reach values\n\nh2. Other Details\n\n* Topics are static for P0 (refresh daily) per working session\n* No trending indicators (up\/down) for P0\n* Connect to Topics API endpoint for data\n\nh3. Future Enhancements (Post-July 1)\n\n* Models with non-null _Representative_Doc_ values for each context area will be added.\n* Structure of the document and classification logic will remain the same.",

    "Description":"As a backend developer, I need to implement the business logic for retrieving and processing community data specific to a company, so that the frontend can display relevant community cards on the homepage.\n\nAs a marketer, I want to see community groups that are relevant to my company, so I can identify untapped markets where my competitors are strong but my brand has limited presence.\n\n*Context*: This ticket is part of the homepage implementation, specifically powering the community cards grid section. The communities displayed represent growth opportunities for brands, showing areas where competitors have penetrated markets that the customer hasn't fully leveraged yet. This is a core value proposition of the Clarvos platform, helping marketers identify untapped markets based on data science.\n\n*User Story*: As a marketing professional using Clarvos, I want to see a curated set of community groups relevant to my company, so I can quickly identify and add the most promising audience segments to my strategy.\n\n*Business Value*:\n\n* Enables marketers to discover untapped audience segments\n* Provides data-driven recommendations for market expansion\n* Helps identify competitive gaps and opportunities\n* Increases the value of the platform by leveraging proprietary community data\n\n*Internal Product Context*: This endpoint supports the community cards grid on the homepage, which displays up to 5 communities initially with the ability to expand to show up to 10 total. Each community card shows the name, reach number, descriptive text, and an \"Add\" button. Communities are presented in order of reach (highest to lowest) and grouped by category.\n\n*Edge Cases*:\n\n* Handle scenarios where a company has fewer than 5 relevant communities\n* Implement fallback strategy for new companies with limited data\n* Handle cases where community reach data might be null or zero\n* Manage potential race conditions in concurrent requests\n* Implement timeout handling for long-running queries\n* Add graceful degradation if related services are unavailable\n\n*Dependencies*:\n\n* Requires Community entity model\n* Needs CompanyRepository for company data access\n* Requires proper database schema with community-company relationships\n* May need integration with Data Science API for relevance calculations",

Although LLMs have a blackbox side to them, prompts that are optimized and tested allow a level of control on the quality of the outputs. These experiments aim to improve the prompts to reduce any unwanted variance while retaining the core functionality.\n\n\u201a\u00c4\u00ee\n\n*DEPENDENCIES*\n\nNo dependencies.",

The MiniLM embedding seem to include stopwords, etc. that makes the model fitting troublesome. The final_text field needs cleaning and Word2Vec embedding locally run so algo could be better designed. Cluster labeling with LDA and {{CountVectorizer}} both look promising, but again the data needs more cleaning upfront.

This will allow us to iterate faster based on actual usage patterns rather than assumptions.\n\nPendo offers several valuable capabilities:\n\n# User analytics and behavioral insights without requiring engineering resources to implement tracking\n# In-app guidance to communicate with users directly within the product\n# Feedback collection to understand what users think about the MVP\n# Feature adoption tracking to see which parts of our MVP are being used\n# User segmentation to understand different user behaviors and needs.",

There are placeholder stories in each of these that I threw together back in the fall - that could easily be updated\/renamed as you see fit.  But we can track these in terms of major milestones of \u201a\u00c4\u00fasite creation\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 pretty easily this way.  Also we could collapse\/combine some of these into fewer epics if you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4d prefer. \n\n\n!image-20250225-011519.png|width=443,height=226,alt=\"image-20250225-011519.png\"!\n\n\n\n",

Topic Intrusion is a statistical technique for identifying a change in the overall discussion. Our initial prototypes used a Bayesian model around the overall term vectors. This can be generalized to work on target dataset with the resulting output being a list of articles.\n\n---\n\n### Definition of Done \u201a\u00c4\u00ec Data Science\n\n- [ ] Goal and business question are clear  \n- [ ] Data or input used is reviewed and appropriate  \n- [ ] Work is version-controlled and reproducible  \n- [ ] Output is documented and easy to understand  \n- [ ] Peer reviewed or checked by a teammate  \n- [ ] Stakeholder has seen or approved the result (if applicable)  \n- [ ] Story is updated and moved to Done in Jira\n",

The idea is that the app will trigger a request to create a context area from the information provided by the app. This will trigger a context area id and when the context area provides the update, the request loop is closed. Going to move this off the current epic and into the backlog for later review if its still necessary in the future.",
