        <h2>How Backlog Health Is Calculated</h2>
        <h3>What We Look At</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Included:</strong> Story tickets in the **active Product Backlog** (those slated for future sprints AND those currently unassigned but actively being groomed)</li>
            <li><strong>Counted as “Healthy”:</strong> Tickets in statuses like <strong>Ready for Development</strong> or <strong>To Do</strong></li>
            <li><em>Not Counted as Healthy:</em> Tickets in <em>New</em>, <em>Grooming</em>, or <em>Backlog</em> statuses</li>
            <li><strong>Excluded:</strong> Tickets that are Done, Canceled, or in active (current/past) sprints</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Backlog Health Calculation</h3>
        <p>
            Backlog Health reflects the percentage of story tickets in the **active Product Backlog** (which includes those slated for future sprints and those that are currently unassigned but actively being groomed) that are in a “Ready for Development” or “To Do” status. These are considered healthy and immediately plannable.
            <br><br>
            Tickets in statuses like “New”, “Grooming”, or “Backlog” are not counted as healthy. However, we display all statuses here to give complete transparency into what’s in the backlog.
        </p>

        <h3>What the Percentages Mean</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>✅ Green: 80% or more ready</li>
            <li>🟡 Yellow: 50–79% ready</li>
            <li>🔴 Red: Less than 50% ready</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Industry References</h3>
        <p>Scrum.org, SAFe, and Atlassian recommend readiness buffer management based on statuses, not velocity.</p>
